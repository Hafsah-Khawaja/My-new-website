<p>Never forget: karate begins with rei and ends with rei (Rei means courtesy or respect, and is represented in karate by bowing)
  There is no first attack in karate
  Karate supports righteousness
  First understand yourself, then understand others
  The art of developing the mind is more important than the art of applying technique
  The mind needs to be freed
  Trouble is born of negligence / ignorance
  Do not think karate belongs only in the dojo
  Karate training requires a lifetime
  Transform everything into karate; therein lies its exquisiteness
  Karate is like hot water, if you do not give it heat constantly, it will again become cold water
  Do not think that you have to win, rather think you do not have to lose
  Transform yourself according to the opponent
  The outcome of the fight depends on one's control
  Imagine one's arms and legs as swords
  Once you leave the shelter of home, there are a million enemies
  Postures are for the beginner; later they are natural positions
  Perform the kata correctly; the real fight is a different matter
  Do not forget control of the dynamics of power, the elasticity of the body and the speed of the technique
  Apply the way of Karate to all things. Therein lies its beauty.
